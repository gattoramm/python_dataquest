In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on gun deaths in the US. By the end, you'll have a notebook that you can add to your portfolio or build on top of on your own. If you need help at any point, you can consult our solution notebook [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission218Solution.ipynb).

The dataset came from [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data). The dataset is stored in the guns.csv file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim. Here are the first few rows of the dataset:
